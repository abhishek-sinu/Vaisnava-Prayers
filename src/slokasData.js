      sanskrit: `ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय\nजन्माद्यस्य यतोऽन्वयादितरतश्चार्थेष्वभिज्ञ: स्वराट्\nतेने ब्रह्म हृदा य आदिकवये मुह्यन्ति यत्सूरय: ।\nतेजोवारिमृदां यथा विनिमयो यत्र त्रिसर्गोऽमृषा\nधाम्ना स्वेन सदा निरस्तकुहकं सत्यं परं धीमहि ॥ १ ॥`,
      english: `oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya\njanmādy asya yato ’nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ\ntene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ\ntejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yathā vinimayo yatra tri-sargo ’mṛṣā\ndhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.`,
      translation: `O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. I meditate upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because He is the Absolute Truth and the primeval cause of all causes of the creation, sustenance and destruction of the manifested universes. He is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations, and He is independent because there is no other cause beyond Him. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge unto the heart of Brahmājī, the original living being. By Him even the great sages and demigods are placed into illusion, as one is bewildered by the illusory representations of water seen in fire, or land seen on water. Only because of Him do the material universes, temporarily manifested by the reactions of the three modes of nature, appear factual, although they are unreal. I therefore meditate upon Him, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is eternally existent in the transcendental abode, which is forever free from the illusory representations of the material world. I meditate upon Him, for He is the Absolute Truth.`

      sanskrit: `धर्म: प्रोज्झितकैतवोऽत्र परमो निर्मत्सराणां सतां\nवेद्यं वास्तवमत्र वस्तु शिवदं तापत्रयोन्मूलनम् ।\nश्रीमद्भागवते महामुनिकृते किं वा परैरीश्वर: \nसद्यो हृद्यवरुध्यतेऽत्र कृतिभि: शुश्रूषुभिस्तत्क्षणात् ॥ २ ॥`,
      english: `dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ\nvedyaṁ vāstavam atra vastu śivadaṁ tāpa-trayonmūlanam\nśrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-muni-kṛte kiṁ vā parair īśvaraḥ\nsadyo hṛdy avarudhyate ’tra kṛtibhiḥ śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt`,
      translation: `Completely rejecting all religious activities which are materially motivated, this Bhāgavata Purāṇa propounds the highest truth, which is understandable by those devotees who are fully pure in heart. The highest truth is reality distinguished from illusion for the welfare of all. Such truth uproots the threefold miseries. This beautiful Bhāgavatam, compiled by the great sage Vyāsadeva [in his maturity], is sufficient in itself for God realization. What is the need of any other scripture? As soon as one attentively and submissively hears the message of Bhāgavatam, by this culture of knowledge the Supreme Lord is established within his heart.`

      translation: `O expert and thoughtful men, relish Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls.`
