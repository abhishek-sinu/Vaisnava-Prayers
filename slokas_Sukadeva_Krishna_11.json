    "sanskrit": "भवभयमपहन्तुं ज्ञानविज्ञानसारं\nनिगमकृदुपजह्रे भृङ्गवद् वेदसारम् ।\nअमृतमुदधितश्चापाययद् भृत्यवर्गान्\nपुरुषमृषभमाद्यं कृष्णसंज्ञं नतोऽस्मि ॥ ४९ ॥",
    "english": "bhava-bhayam apahantuṁ jñāna-vijñāna-sāraṁ\nnigama-kṛd upajahre bhṛṅga-vad veda-sāram\namṛtam udadhitaś cāpāyayad bhṛtya-vargān\npuruṣam ṛṣabham ādyaṁ kṛṣṇa-saṁjñaṁ nato ’smi",
    "translation": "I offer my obeisances to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original and greatest of all beings, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the author of the Vedas, and just to destroy His devotees’ fear of material existence, like a bee He has collected this nectarean essence of all knowledge and self-realization. Thus He has awarded to His many devotees this nectar from the ocean of bliss, and by His mercy they have drunk it."
