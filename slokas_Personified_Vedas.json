    "sanskrit": "स यदजया त्वजामनुशयीत गुणांश्च जुषन्\nभजति सरूपतां तदनु मृत्युमपेतभग: ।\nत्वमुत जहासि तामहिरिव त्वचमात्तभगो\nमहसि महीयसेऽष्टगुणितेऽपरिमेयभग: ॥ ३८ ॥",
    "english": "sa yad ajayā tv ajām anuśayīta guṇāṁś ca juṣan\nbhajati sarūpatāṁ tad anu mṛtyum apeta-bhagaḥ\ntvam uta jahāsi tām ahir iva tvacam ātta-bhago\nmahasi mahīyase ’ṣṭa-guṇite ’parimeya-bhagaḥ",
    "translation": "The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences."

    "sanskrit": "यदि न समुद्धरन्ति यतयो हृदि कामजटा\nदुरधिगमोऽसतां हृदि गतोऽस्मृतकण्ठमणि: ।\nअसुतृपयोगिनामुभयतोऽप्यसुखं भगव-\nन्ननपगतान्तकादनधिरूढपदाद् भवत: ॥ ३९ ॥",
    "english": "yadi na samuddharanti yatayo hṛdi kāma-jaṭā\nduradhigamo ’satāṁ hṛdi gato ’smṛta-kaṇṭha-maṇiḥ\nasu-tṛpa-yoginām ubhayato ’py asukhaṁ bhagavann\nanapagatāntakād anadhirūḍha-padād bhavataḥ",
    "translation": "Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts, for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a man who has totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who practice yoga only for sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next: from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they cannot reach."

    "sanskrit": "त्वदवगमी न वेत्ति भवदुत्थशुभाशुभयो-\nर्गुणविगुणान्वयांस्तर्हि देहभृतां च गिर: ।\nअनुयुगमन्वहं सगुण गीतपरम्परया\nश्रवणभृतो यतस्त्वमपवर्गगतिर्मनुजै: ॥ ४० ॥",

    "translation": "When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by the unbroken succession of Manu’s descendants, and thus You become his ultimate salvation."

    "translation": "Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion."
